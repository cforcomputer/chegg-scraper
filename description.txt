Hi there,Just trying to finish homework for the first section and Iamunsure of this problem. (see below.)1.26 A Flashlight Battery has a rating of 0.8ampere-hours (Ah)and a lifetime of 10hours.a) How much current can it deliver?b) How much power can it give if its terminal voltage is6V?c) How much energy is stored in the battery in kWh?I started by trying to determine the amperage ofthebattery.- I performed the following operation:0.8 A* h  [divided by] 10 h : in order toeliminate the h(hour) units.So I have a value of 0.08 A. What the heck do I do now?/
I need solution for these problems/
