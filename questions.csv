<div>Just trying to finish homework for the first section and I
amunsure of this problem. (see below.)</div>
<div>1.26 A Flashlight Battery has a rating of 0.8ampere-hours (Ah)
and a lifetime of 10  <br/>
         hours.</div>
<div>a) How much current can it deliver?</div>
<div>b) How much power can it give if its terminal voltage is
6V?</div>
<div>c) How much energy is stored in the battery in kWh?</div>
<div>I started by trying to determine the amperage of
thebattery.</div>
<div>- I performed the following operation:<br/>
<br/>
0.8 A* h  [divided by] 10 h : in order toeliminate the h
(hour) units.<br/>
So I have a value of 0.08 A. What the heck do I do now?</div>
